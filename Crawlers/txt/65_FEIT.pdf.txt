FALCON
FALCON considers delivery of wireless communication and server-based (i.e. web-based) services using 
state-of-the-art concepts in modern communication networks. Specifically, the project aims to develop an 
agile management system that meets high-level reliability, availability, and service requirements by adapting 
the communication network in terms of allocation of computing resources (i.e. processor load, RAM memory, 
etc.)  and networking resources (i.e. throughput, number of served users, etc.) based on the underlying 
conditions. Thus, the resulting communication system/platform will be able to adapt not only to surges in 
demand (large number of users), but also to emergency scenarios, such as disasters or terrorist attacks.

IOT SOLTRACK
The goal of the Project was development and testing of a prototype for a foldable and mobile photovoltaic 
battery system, designed to be applicable for supplying electrically autonomous systems. The potential 
application of the product is in the agricultural sector, especially in areas where farmers have no access to 
the power distribution network needed to supply electric water pumps and other electricity demands.

MAGNUM
MAGNUM focuses on dynamic optimization and computational resource allocation for virtualised container-
based 4G deployment. Specifically, it evaluates the effects and topology of a Resource Controller that 
dynamically allocates the optimal computational resources (CPU and memory), based on the underlying 
communication resource requirements, in a multi-user, multi-cell, and multi-tenant 4G deployment. The results 
clearly show the benefits and advantages of virtualised C-RAN compared to conventional RAN, providing 
valuable insights for future practical deployment.

49GROUND PENETRATING RADAR (GPR) 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Integrated to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for Automatic Mine Detection: 
The project was financed within the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme. This project 
investigated methods and strategies for land mine detection using radar technology and UAV. The goal was 
to develop a low-cost and lightweight GPR using standard radio frequency components and integrate it with a 
commercially available UAV. Advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms were developed to 
detect, localize, and classify underground objects (such as land mines).

Projects@FEEIT
50CROSSBOW
The main objective of the project was to propose the shared use of resources to foster cross-border 
management of variable renewable energies (RES) and storage units, enabling a higher penetration of clean 
energies whilst reducing network operational costs and improving economic benefits of RES and storage 
units. Nine products were designed to contribute to the project objective.
Projects@FEEIT
WIDEHEALTH
WideHealth is a H2020 TWINNING project. The main goal is to enable a new generation of young researchers 
in the field of e-health, who will research and find new technological solutions with the help of the latest 
technologies and artificial intelligence. Within the framework of the 30-month project, 3 international schools, 
4 e-health courses (which are publicly available and young people can be educated about e-health), about 
20 seminars on topics and about 20 scientific papers were organized. The research and scientific topics 
covered by the numerous activities of the project include: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Human 
Behavior Analysis, Virtual Reality, Sensors, Medical Data Processing, etc.
